This is a README file for the project 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O.
This project has the following tasks;
1. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
2. Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
3. Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
4. Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
5. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
6. Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
